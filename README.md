# River Thames Tidal Variation

Time series analysis of historical sea level records for every gauge along River Thames, 1911-1995.

Methods:
- Wrote function to import and load 13 datasets, one for each tidal gauge
- Performed manipulation, cleaning, and merging to prepare datasets for analysis
- Defined interquartile range function and used it to calculate summary statistics
- Calculated ratios based on highest tide levels and lowest tide levels
- Wrote for loops to generate line plots displaying monthly average water levels (with confidence intervals) across all years for each gauge location 
- Wrote for loops to generate boxplots and inspect water level distributions for each gauge location
